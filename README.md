# Week-1-Challenge

This repository includes the content for Coding Bootcamp's Module 1/week 1's challenge. 

## Description
The task is to refactor Horiseon's webpage to make it accessible and to improve Search Engine Optimization (SEO). 

## Software
I have used Visual Studio Code for the project to update the index.html and style.css documents. 

# Refactor
I have added semantic HTML elements, and they follow a rational structure aside from any postioning and/or styling.
I have added alt attributes to the image and icon elements for accessibility.
I have updated the heading attributes to make sure they are in sequential order.
I updated the title element to give it a descriptive title.
